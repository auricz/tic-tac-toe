# tic-tac-toe
A C# program that lets you play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer.

You'll enter a number (1 to 9) whenever it is your turn, and that number represents the spot on the board that you want to take. 
After your turn, the computer will pick a spot that'll try to win or prevent you from getting a 3-in-a-row.
